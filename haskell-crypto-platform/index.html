<h1 class="page-title">haskell crypto platform</h1>
<span class="post-date">Published on 2013-10-25</span>
<p>One of my side projects that has been running for couple of years now,
was to get Cryptography up to scratch in haskell. Back when
I started <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tls">TLS</a>, there were many
various cryptography related projects and libraries. Many were not easy to use,
none were consistent, many had performance problems.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Just like the haskell platform, I dreamt of having a go-to set of packages
for cryptography. This is why i've started this project on a side of actual packages.</p>
<p>Currently the platform is made of those features:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASN.1: a terrible serialization format, that is unfortunately pervasive in cryptography.</li>
<li>X.509: public certificate infrastructure based on ASN.1.</li>
<li>symmetric ciphers (block and stream): RC4, DES (inherited from Crypto), 3DES, Blowfish, Camellia, AES</li>
<li>cryptographic hashes (SHA1, SHA2, SHA3, MD2, MD4, MD5, ...) and siphash</li>
<li>assymetric ciphers: RSA, DSA, DH</li>
<li>cryptographic randomness: entropy gathering, Pseudo and random secure bytes generation</li>
<li>securemem: auto scrubbing &quot;bytestring&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-side-note-about-reimplementing-cryptography">A side note, about reimplementing cryptography</h2>
<p>Many people would think that it is a foolish project to reimplement cryptography.
It's undeniable, that cryptography is a hard subject and it's easy to get
some stuff horribly wrong. And many people would rather use references
implementations out there (openssl, nacl, ..).</p>
<p>There's still some values in this, despite not having always the best and most audited implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li>portability: all the code available run on all 3 platforms without having to install external libraries</li>
<li>some cryptography code doesn't require implementation security: for example verifying RSA signature, decrypting your local files for your own purpose, etc.</li>
<li>More diversity: monoculture is dangerous.</li>
<li>It's much more haskell friendly :-)</li>
<li>A common API framework that alternative implementation could/can use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite not necessarily being the best cryptography code out there,
I do want to stress that I still consider many of the libraries
available throught this platform to be good in many contexts.</p>
<h2 id="we-want-you">We want you ..</h2>
<p>Despite my end goals, not everything is as good as I would want,
some ciphers inherited from Crypto are slows, some API not ideal, etc.</p>
<p>Open a discussion somewhere on one of the tracker, send some pull requests,
send me email about supporting your favorite feature, etc..</p>
<p>The organisational part of the platform is not yet defined, while in the process of making stuff
up, i do value suggestions on how to organize. </p>
<p>Also, more documentation would be nice, and while i'm trying to document everything, it would
be better to have end-user trying to document pieces that is not documented well enough.
As an author, it's sometimes difficult to judge where more or better documentation would be
needed.</p>
<h2 id="other-implementations">Other implementations</h2>
<p>One of the side goals of the platform, that I would like to see developed,
would be to also provide implementation alternatives with the same API infrastructure.</p>
<p>Thanks to Stefan BÃ¼hler there's already one package that wander in this direction:</p>
<p><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/nettle">nettle haskell bindings</a></p>
<p>I'm looking forward to similar packages covering other parts of the platform.</p>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>For maximum usability, everything in the crypto-platform is under the BSD3 license.
All additions will be required to be under the same (or very similar) license too.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-crypto-platform">The main repository</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-crypto-platform/blob/master/README.md">platform README</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/tag/crypto-platform">individual packages list</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There's also a google group where to ask question about the packages:</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskell-crypto-platform">google group - haskell crypto platform</a></p>
<p>And of course, the issue tracker of either specific packages or the platform one on github.</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p>
